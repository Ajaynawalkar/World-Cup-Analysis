- Exploratory Data Analysis Cricket World Cup with 13 Teams and Plot Visualization.
- Data Cleaning Process with Python Language( Jupyter Notebook ) ,In this project, we'll be analyzing a dataset & Observe the Game play with the all over player economy   in the Batting Figures and Bowling Figures.
## Python Libraries used in project:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
## CONTENT:
- 1)Introduction to Data : The dataset contains 33 records distrbuted in 24 columns.
- 2)Null Value and Reduction : There is 0 Null Values , So the Data is Clean and no null values are present.
- 3)Dataset Information : Data types - float64(2), int64(4), object(13).
- 4)Statistical Information : Correlation, Covariance, & Standard Deviation.
- 5)Statistical Figures : Mean, Median and Mode.
- 6)Pivot Table : This pivot table shows the matches played between team_1 and team_2 & In other pivot it shows the target by the teams in the tournament.
## Visualizations :-
- a] Heatmap - In the plot it shows the correlation between the all attributes in the dataset & 
               By the observation we see the relation between the order quantity and cost of the product is very strong.
- b] Bargraph - To show Target score by Team 1 & Team 2.
- c] Pie Chart - In the given pie chart it shows the score distribution of the teams.
- d] Count Plot - Count the number of match winning by the individual team in the tournament.
